Introduction:

Welcome to RenC#!

If, for some reason, you don't know what you've installed, RenC# is a visual novel system for Unity
that has been designed with the goal of not needing to open an IDE a single time to make a VN.

I've included an example project with some generic prefabs to help you get started, if you don't want to deal with
the hassle of setting up your own scenes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actors and Sequences:

Actors and sequences make up the bulk of the bulk of your projects. They are both scriptable objects, with actors
containing information relating to the speakers (having names and visual information), while sequences contain
all of the dialog boxes that will be said along with player choices. They are both created in the context menu
in the inspector.

I've included more READMEs in every scripts subfolder and tried to make as many useful comments I could. If
you want to learn more about how these systems work, start with the READMEs and then check the comments. The
included example project should make it easy to troubleshoot if you're missing a specific component.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs and Reporting:

I make no guarantees that the systems I've developed are perfect or bug-free, I'm not stupid. That said, if you
encounter a bug or other issue, please make sure to check if it wasn't the result of a custom implementation that
you developed. The included example project SHOULD make onboarding as painless as possible.

If you find a bug in my system, that you can definitively prove is a result of the system's failed logic, you
can either make a comment on the Unity Package page, or email me directly at "bobsywoo@gmail.com." If you do
email me, please make sure your header makes it clear that you're emailing about a bug in RenC#.

Of course, since the code is all in your project, you have my permission to edit whatever you see fit. Naturally,
you are not able to distribute this altered code and claim it as your own. You can create merge requests directly
on my GitHub repo here: https://github.com/Scootic/RenCSharp. Whether or not they go through? IDK man.
