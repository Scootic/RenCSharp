  poemText: 'The Raccoon


    It happened in the dead of night while I was slicing
    bread for a guilty snack.

    My attention was caught by the scuttering of
    a raccoon outside my window.

    That was, I believe, the first time I noticed
    my strange tendencies as an unordinary

    human.

    I gave the raccoon
    a piece of bread, my subconscious well aware of the consequences.

    Well
    aware that a raccoon that is fed will always come back for more.

    The enticing
    beauty of my cutting knife was the symptom.

    The bread, my hungry curiosity.

    The
    raccoon, an urge.

    

    The moon increments its phase and reflects that
    much more light off of my cutting

    knife.

    The very same light that
    glistens in the eyes of my raccoon friend.

    I slice the bread, fresh and
    soft. The raccoon becomes excited.

    or perhaps I''m merely projecting my
    emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.

    

    The raccoon has taken
    to following me.

    You could say that we''ve gotten quite used to each other.

    The
    raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.

    Every
    time I brandish my cutting knife the raccoon shows me its excitement.

    A
    rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.

    

    

    And
    I feed myself again.'
