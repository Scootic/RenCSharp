  poemText: 'Bottles


    I pop off my scalp like the lid of a cookie jar.

    It''s
    the secret place where I keep all my dreams.

    Little balls of sunshine,
    all rubbing together like a bundle of kittens.

    

    I reach inside with
    my thumb and forefinger and pluck one out.

    It''s warm and tingly.

    But
    there''s no time to waste! I put it in a bottle to keep it safe.

    And I
    put the bottle on the shelf with all of the other bottles.

    Happy thoughts,
    happy thoughts, happy thoughts in bottles, all in a row.

    

    My collection
    makes me lots of friends.

    Each bottle a starlight to make amends.

    Sometimes
    my friend feels a certain way.

    Down comes a bottle to save the day.

    

    Night
    after night, more dreams.

    Friend after friend, more bottles.

    Deeper
    and deeper my fingers go.

    Like exploring a dark cave, discovering the secrets
    hiding in the nooks and crannies.

    Digging and digging.

    Scraping and
    scraping.

    

    I blow dust off my bottle caps.

    It doesn''t feel
    like time elapsed.

    My empty shelf could use some more.

    My friends
    look through my locked front door.

    

    Finally, all done. I open up,
    and in come my friends.

    In they come, in such a hurry. Do they want my
    bottles that much?

    I frantically pull them from the shelf, one after the
    other.

    Holding them out to each and every friend.

    Each and every
    bottle.

    But every time I let one go, it shatters against the tile between
    my feet.

    Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts in shards, all
    over the floor.

    

    They were supposed to be for my friends, my friends
    who aren''t smiling.

    They''re all shouting, pleading. Something.

    But
    all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo

    Inside my head.'
