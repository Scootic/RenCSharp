  poemText: 'Amy Likes Spiders


    You know what I heard about Amy?

    Amy likes
    spiders.

    Icky, wriggly, hairy, ugly spiders!

    That''s why I''m not
    friends with her.

    

    Amy has a cute singing voice.

    I heard her
    singing my favorite love song.

    Every time she sang the chorus, my heart
    would pound to the rhythm of the words.

    But she likes spiders.

    That''s
    why I''m not friends with her.

    

    One time, I hurt my leg really bad.

    Amy
    helped me up and took me to the nurse.

    I tried not to let her touch me.

    She
    likes spiders, so her hands are probably gross.

    That''s why I''m not friends
    with her.

    

    Amy has a lot of friends.

    I always see her talking
    to people.

    She probably talks about spiders.

    What if her friends
    start to like spiders too?

    That''s why I''m not friends with her.

    

    It
    doesn''t matter if she has other hobbies.

    It doesn''t matter if she keeps
    it private.

    It doesn''t matter if it doesn''t hurt anyone.

    

    It''s
    gross.

    She''s gross.

    The world is better off without spider lovers.

    

    And
    I''m gonna tell everyone.'
