  poemText: 'Ghost Under the Light


    The tendrils of my hair illuminate beneath
    the amber glow.

    Bathing.

    It must be this one.

    The last remaining
    streetlight to have withstood the test of time.

    The last yet to be replaced
    by the sickening blue-green hue of the future.

    I bathe. Calm; breathing
    air of the present but living in the past.

    The light flickers.

    I
    flicker back.'
