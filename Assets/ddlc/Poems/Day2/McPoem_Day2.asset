  poemText: 'The Projector


    Alone it sits, a machine of illusions;

    the
    projector has been dormant for years.


    Collecting dust, it awaits any input,
    which will likely never come again.


    Projectors can only show what their
    beams land on: a surface;

    a memory, a moment, a frame.


    Notably absent
    is depth, context, scope;

    their projection can only ever be flat, lifeless.


    Even
    if it did receive input, even if it was turned on,

    would it truly be alive?


    Is
    it the same for you?'
