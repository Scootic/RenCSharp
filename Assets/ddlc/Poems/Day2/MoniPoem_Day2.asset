  poemText: 'Hole in Wall


    It couldn''t have been me.

    See, the direction
    the spackle protrudes.

    A noisy neighbor? An angry boyfriend? I''ll never
    know. I wasn''t home.

    I peer inside for a clue.

    No! I can''t see.
    I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun.

    But it''s too late. My
    retinas.

    Already scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image.

    It''s
    just a little hole. It wasn''t too bright.

    It was too deep.

    Stretching
    forever into everything.

    A hole of infinite choices.

    I realize now,
    that I wasn''t looking in.

    I was looking out.

    And he, on the other
    side, was looking in.'
