  poemText: 'Dear Sunshine


    The way you glow through my blinds in the morning

    It
    makes me feel like you missed me.

    Kissing my forehead to help me out of
    bed.

    Making me rub the sleepy from my eyes.

    

    Are you asking
    me to come out and play?

    Are you trusting me to wish away a rainy day?

    I
    look above. The sky is blue.

    It''s a secret, but I trust you too.

    

    If
    it wasn''t for you, I could sleep forever.

    But I''m not mad.

    

    I
    want breakfast.'
