  poemText: "The Four Rocky Planets\n\nAround the sun orbits four rocky planets:\nMercury,
    Venus, Earth, and Mars.\n\nMercury has always been close, never straying too
    far.\nShe has lots of energy, which she uses to cheer up all of her friends.\nThe
    sun treasures her compassion.\n\nVenus hides behind a thick layer of clouds,
    scared to reveal the surface beneath.\nOne day, she trusted the sun to see some
    of her surface. It was unique and beautiful.\nThe sun treasures her truth.\n\nEarth,
    full of life, is a chaotic planet.\nShe has both turbulent storms, and relaxing
    calm waters.\nDespite it all, she has the soft and nurturing environment to facilitate
    life.\nThe sun treasures her back-handed affection.\n\nMars, despite being the
    most distant, helps keep the rest in order.\nEven if the sun and her fellow planets
    get rowdy, she helps assure and direct.\nThe sun treasures her dignity. \n\nEven
    if the sun has only really gotten to know Venus, Earth, and Mars recently, he
    can think of few others he would rather spend his afternoons with.\n\nMe too."
