  poemText: 'The Woods


    Green leaves, wooden trees;

    the birds sing to greet
    the day.


    Blue stream, wet thing;

    the fish swim and spray.


    Yellow
    sun, reveals all fun;

    it beams down to help all grow.


    Brown critters,
    frolick and skitter;

    fast in the morning, in the evening they slow.


    Gray
    clouds, from northward abound;

    winter is coming, life is fading.


    White
    snow, descends below;

    they are not dead, they lie in waiting.


    The
    woodsman has seen it all, and he knows the Golden truth:

    the woods lives
    in cycles, always birthing new youth.
