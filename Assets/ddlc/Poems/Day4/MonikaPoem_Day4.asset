  poemText: 'The Lady Who Knew Everything


    An old tale tells of a lady who wanders
    Earth.

    The Lady who Knows Everything.

    A beautiful lady who has found
    every answer,

    All meaning,

    All purpose,

    And all that was ever
    sought.

    

    And here I am,

    

    a feather

    

    Lost
    adrift the sky, victim of the currents of the wind.

    

    Day after day,
    I search.

    I search with little hope, knowing legends don''t exist.

    But
    when all else has failed me,

    When all others have turned away,

    The
    legend is all that remains-the last dim star glimmering in the twilit sky.

    

    Until
    one day, the wind ceases to blow.

    I fall.

    And I fall and fall, and
    fall even more.

    Gentle as a feather.

    A dry quill, expressionless.

    

    But
    a hand catches me, between the thumb and forefinger.

    The hand of a beautiful
    lady.

    I look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze.

    

    The
    Lady who Knows Everything knows what I am thinking.

    Before I can speak,
    she responds in a hollow voice.

    "I have found every answer, all of which
    amount to nothing.

    There is no meaning.

    There is no purpose.

    And
    we seek only the impossible.

    I am not your legend.

    Your legend does
    not exist."

    

    And with a breath, she blows me back afloat, and I pick
    up a gust of wind.'
