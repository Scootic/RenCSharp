  poemText: "Ghost Under the Light - Pt. 2\n\nThe tendrils of my hair illuminate
    beneath the amber glow.\r\nBathing.\r\nIn the distance, a blue-green light flickers.\r\nA
    lone figure crosses its path\u2013 a silhouette obstructing the eerie glow.\r\nMy
    heart pounds. The silhouette grows. Closer Closer\r\nI open my umbrella, casting
    a shadow to shield me from visibility.\r\nBut I am too late.\r\nHe steps into
    the streetlight. I gasp and drop my umbrella.\r\nThe light flickers. My heart
    pounds. He raises his arm.\r\n\r\nTime stops.\r\n\r\nThe only indication of movement
    is the amber light flickering against his outstretched\r\narm.\r\nThe flickering
    light is in rhythm with the pounding of my heart.\r\nTeasing me for succumbing
    to this forbidden emotion.\r\nHave you ever heard of a ghost feeling warmth before?\r\nGiving
    up on understanding, I laugh.\r\nUnderstanding is overrated.\r\nI touch his hand.
    The flickering stops.\r\nGhosts are blue-green. My heart is amber."
