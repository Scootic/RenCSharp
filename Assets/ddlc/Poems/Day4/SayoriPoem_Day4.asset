  poemText: 'Dear Sunshine - Pt. 2


    The way you glow through my blinds in the
    morning

    It makes me feel like you missed me.

    And I missed you, too.

    

    Kissing
    my forehead to help me out of bed.

    Making me rub the sleepy from my eyes.

    

    Are
    you asking me to come out and play?

    Are you trusting me to wish away a
    rainy day?

    Or are you asking for something more

    The same thing I''m
    asking for?

    

    I look above. The sky is blue.

    Rainclouds approach,
    but so do you.

    

    If it wasn''t for you, I would sleep forever.

    So
    I''m glad you''re here, always beaming on me.

    

    I want your breakfast.'
