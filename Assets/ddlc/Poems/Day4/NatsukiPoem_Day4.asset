  poemText: 'I''ll Be Your Beach


    Your mind is so full of troubles and fears

    That
    diminished your wonder over the years

    But today I have a special place

    A
    beach for us to go.

    

    A shore reaching beyond your sight

    A sea
    that sparkles with brilliant light

    The walls in your mind will melt away

    Before
    the sunny glow.

    

    I''ll be the beach that washes your worries away

    I''ll
    be the beach that you daydream about each day

    I''ll be the beach that makes
    your heart leap

    In a way you thought had left you long ago.

    

    Let''s
    bury your heavy thoughts in a pile of sand

    Bathe in sunbeams and hold my
    hand

    Wash your insecurities in the salty sea

    And let me see you shine.

    

    Let''s
    leave your memories in a footprint trail

    Set you free in my windy sail

    And
    remember the reasons you''re wonderful

    When you press your lips to mine.

    

    I''ll
    be the beach that washes your worries away

    I''ll be the beach that you
    daydream about each day

    I''ll be the beach that makes your heart leap

    In
    a way you thought had left you long ago.

    

    But if you let me by your
    side

    Your own beach, your own escape

    You''ll learn to love yourself
    again.'
